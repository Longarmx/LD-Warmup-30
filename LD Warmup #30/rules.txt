Theme: Parallel Worlds
Time Start: 5:30pm Saturday, August 16
Deadline: 5:30pm Monday, August 18
Time Completed: 4:00pm Tuesday, August 19 (6 Hours of real work)

Ideas:
You control two characters at the same time, but they are in separate worlds. You have
to control both of them to travel from a starting point to an ending point. Walls will
stop them from moving, which essentially lets you only control one character. There
can also be special pads which 'disconnect' the clone and allow you to control one
character until they reach a 'connect' pad. Obstacles may include monsters, traps, and
environmental hazards.

Visuals:
Cartoon look; Tile based; Birds eye view;
